# A Homespun Bitcoin Server

## Project description

This repository contains a guide to building a simple Bitcoin server from the ground up—that is, without the support of a prepacked node solution such as myNode, Nodl One, Umbrel, and Raspiblitz. 

The server will include a Bitcoin Core node, an electrum server, a local block explorer, and a locally connected wallet. You can build out this basic Bitcoin server with further applications on your own.  


## Motivation and aims

While node solutions offer a nice and convenient product for many people, building your own Bitcoin server from the ground up—or at least, somewhat more from the ground up—does have various advantages. This guide offers a recipe for making a homespun Bitcoin server that even less technical audiences can follow with some elbow grease. We spend a lot of time on ***why to do things*** rather than just ***how to do things***.
