# Disclaimer and Warning

## Disclaimer

Your security in using bitcoin, the currency, is your own responsibility. This guide is for informational and educational purposes only. I am not liable for any financial losses you might incurr using this information.


## Warning

If you have found this guide because you want to start managing your own bitcoin (rather than have them on an exchange), I recommend strongly that you first turn to learning about secure Bitcoin storage. Particularly, you should learn about using hardware wallets and adopting best practices for managing your Bitcoin keys.

You will find many good sources online for the basics of bitcoin storage. I would recommend consulting videos from Andreas Antonopoulos for beginners.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

For learning about key management on a more advanced level, it is vital that you understand the concept of hierarchical deterministic wallets and extended public keys. You can consult the explainer in my "Bitcoin Explainers" repository <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>. There is a also a nice explanation from a Youtube channel called Mobilefish.com.<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> 

For using multisignature addresses, Michael Flaxman’s “10x Security Bitcoin Guide” is a good source of information.<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup> His guide is reasonably accessible, even for less technical users (though he seems to believe the contrary). 

Whenever making the move to storing your own bitcoin, I would strongly urge you to always begin with small amounts of money: make mistakes and you could lose it all.
